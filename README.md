Adventure Escape is a game made in Unity3D which involves three levels of varying complexity that the character has to clear in order to win. This is a very interesting game that can be played by someone who loves the thrill of finding clues and escaping with the help of them.

The game makes use of first-person view. The player has to escape each level using different procedures which he/she will have to figure out by observing his/her environment. He/She will have to interact with various objects and surroundings throughout the game. For the purpose of interaction, the player can use either mouse or keyboard. Different keys like arrow keys are used to move around. For the player to move faster, shift can be used along with arrow keys. “E” is used to open the doors. Left mouse click when pressed allows the
player to pick up certain objects in the scene. When it is released, the objects get dropped.

To create the game, several game objects have been put into use, i.e. 3D objects. For example, a cube is used to build things, and a few objects such as a sofa, pillow and table are taken from the asset store. We have also used different lights which include directional light and spot light. Audio effects in the form of background music is used. Text boxes are used for displaying messages and clues. Canvas holds all the texts together and physical effects such as gravity are added to different objects. Some of the objects use certain components of physics like Rigid body, capsule collider or box collider.

In each level of the game, the player needs to first find the key and then go around the room to find the doors. Only after finding them, the player will be able to move to the next level. 

In the first level, the player encounters a maze but it is not any ordinary maze. The player needs to find his way out as quickly as possible. He/ She needs to find a key which is hidden somewhere in the maze which opens a door. Only after doing so, the player can escape level one. 

The second level starts once the player opens the door in level one. This level is also like the previous one except here, the player first needs to find a clue to know where the key might be hidden as the scene consists of a house. Once the player is able to crack what the clue means, he/she can find the key to open the door of the 2nd level and enters the third level.

The third level is a quiz round which is divided into three parts as in three questions. This level consists of three door each question be put on the sceen when the player is about the interact with the door and once the player answer the questions correctly then the last door open and the game ends.
So, stayed tuned for upcoming levels. Hence the player enjoys the game as an adventure, by escaping from different environments.
